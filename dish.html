            Pressure Cooker Sambar Rice
            
            We all have those days where we look for something simple, something quick but also something comforting and at the same time delicious. Today’s recipe Sambar Sadam is all that and more. Instead of making Sambar and rice separately, I often make one-pot Sambar Rice in my pressure cooker. It is loaded with vegetables, as I usually throw in every vegetable in my fridge (best way to clean up your fridge). The rice and toor dal are cooked to a perfect mash and the ready-to-use sambar powder adds a great flavor to the rice. I serve it with chips, fryums or a simple roast/fry – always turns out to be a winner!</a>

                Sambar Rice In Pressure Cooker
                Sambar Rice, quite popular in Tamilnadu hotels as Sambar Sadam is a delicious concoction of rice, dal and mixed vegetables. If you are wondering how is it different from the Karnataka special Bisibelebath, in this recipe we add everything together in one shot into a pressure cooker, cook everything to a mash and then temper it. There is no need for making a special spice blend or roasting pulses, as we use sambar powder there by saving time & effort. As it made in pressure cooker, it just takes 30mins to make it from scratch.
                
                The one stand-out when it comes to my Sambar rice - I usually temper mustard seeds, cumin seeds, fresh curry leaves, asafoetida in ghee instead of oil. Also, I add finely chopped onions or shallots and fry them to a golden-brown color. It adds to both the texture and taste of the rice.</a>

    Simple Curd Rice can be prepared with steamed rice and plain curd or with additional tempering of urad dal, mustard seeds, chillies, coriander leaves and steamed rice. This recipe uses the second method to make it tastier. It is a “must have” item as part of lunch or dinner in south Indian household and can be prepared instantly in short amount of time with very little effort. This recipe is an ideal Bachelor’s recipe for stomach filling instant food preparation at any time.
